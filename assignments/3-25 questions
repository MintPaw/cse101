Bad functionality entails that the program does not easily do all the of the things that were intended.

2. Briefly discuss requirements elicitation in SDLC and what modeling approach is typically used for the actives
SDLC is a cycle in which software can be flexibly developed the steps are:
	1. Requirement Elicitation (Figuring out what the program should have to do)
	2. Analysis
	3. System Design
	4. Object Design
	5. Implementation
	6. Testing
